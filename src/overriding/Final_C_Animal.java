package overriding;

// Important, this class of     FInal_C  and also      Final_D   &     Final_E  are expressed in a different format (As compared to A_cat  & B_dog)
// in order to explain, the overriding concept in Java. Hence, simply treat it as an interview question where you're presented with these 3 .java class files.


//Now, Simply observe this class....

public class Final_C_Animal {
	
	 // Method that's going to be overridden
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
